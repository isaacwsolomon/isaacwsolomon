## About Me
I'm a software development student currently studying at ATU Galway. Here you will find some of my college projects and some of my own fun creations. Currently working on FruitSalad which is a charade like game that you can play with your friends. I am always eager to upskill myself and learn new technologies.

🌱Currently learning: Full-stack development, Docker, Kubernetes, Data Modelling

⚙️ Working with: ```Java```, ```JavaScript```, ```React```, ```React Native```, ```Node.js```, ```MySQL```, ```MongoDB```

📍 Based in: Galway, Ireland

## 🛠 Projects
### [Fruit Salad](https://github.com/isaacwsolomon/FruitSalad2025)
The game starts once every player has written at least 5 words / sentences and entered them into the game. Players are then divided into teams. There are 4 rounds, the first round players must explain the randomly chosen entry without saying any of the words, their team must guess what is written on the entry. Once all entries have been gotten the next round is the act it out round. The following round players can only say one word, and finally the last round players may only make noises (no words or actions).  
The game is written using ```JavaScritpt```, ```Node.js```, ```Express.js```, ```MongoDB```, ```Socket.IO```

### [Relax-App](https://github.com/isaacwsolomon/Relax-App)
A mobile app I created with two of my friends. The idea of the app is to relieve stress when it is used. It has features such as relaxing background sounds(rain, fire, wind), relaxing music, satisfying bubble popping game, breathing exercises, mood tracker, study guide timer. Its built in ```React Native``` and uses ```Firebase``` for authentication and data storage
